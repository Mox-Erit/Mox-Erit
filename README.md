# Ahoy! My name is Chase (not the bank)

Currently I work as a Lead Software Engineer with the <a href="https://mt.gov/">State of Montana</a>. 

In the past I have been fortunate to be able to have worked in federal, state, and private sectors across multiple industries! This has led me to be able to take on all kinds of challenges and unique roles.

## What I am currently working on

A Threlte (Svelte + Three.JS) template site for eCommerce customization of products. With a focus on accessibility, unique presentation, and snappy interactions.

AI co-pilot (Elixir + Axon) for sailors in navigating global maritime laws, common sailing procedures, and use of safety measures. I am scaling this project with my custom made RC vehicles to eventually be used on larger vessels.
