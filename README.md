# Ahoy! My name is Chase and I love to tinker!

Currently I work as a Lead Software Engineer with the <a href="https://mt.gov/">State of Montana</a>. 

In the past I have been fortunate to be able to have worked in federal, state, and private sectors across multiple industries! This has led me to be able to take on all kinds of challenges and unique roles.


## Projects from my current job

Re-build of <a href="https://lmi.delaware.gov/">Labor Market Index Delaware</a> onto our Cascade CMS enviornment from Wordpress. Extensive rewrite of React, addition of 508 accessibility, and Tableau.

Conversion of Montana's state homepage <a href="https://mt.gov/">mt.gov</a> from a .NET stack hosted on GitLab to our Cascade CMS stack which utilizes Apache Velocity, jQuery, and SCSS.

Lead the development of <a href="https://liv.mt.gov/Brands-Enforcement/Find-a-brand-inspector">Department of Livestock Brand Inspector</a> search page for our citizens. Really got to enjoy making an accessible search repository using DataTables jQuery and Cascade CMS.


## What I am currently working on

A Threlte template (Svelte + Three.JS) website for eCommerce customization of products. With a focus on accessibility, unique presentation, and snappy interactions.

AI co-pilot for recreational sailors in navigating global maritime laws, procedures, and policies. (Elixir + Axon)
