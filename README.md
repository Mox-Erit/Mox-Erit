# Ahoy! My name is Chase and I love to tinker!

Currently I work as a Lead Software Engineer with the <a href="https://mt.gov/">State of Montana</a>. 

In the past I have been fortunate to be able to have worked in federal, state, and private sectors across multiple industries! This has led me to be able to wear multiple hats as I really enjoy being able to take part in any stage of a project. 


## Projects from my current job

- Re-build of <a href="https://lmi.delaware.gov/">Labor Market Index Delaware</a> onto our Cascade CMS enviornment from Wordpress. Extensive rewrite of React, addition of 508 accessibility, and Tableau.
- Conversion of Montana's state homepage <a href="https://mt.gov/">mt.gov</a> from a .NET stack hosted on GitLab to our Cascade CMS stack which utilizes Apache Velocity, jQuery, and SCSS.
- Lead the development of <a href="https://liv.mt.gov/Brands-Enforcement/Find-a-brand-inspector">Department of Livestock Brand Inspector</a> search page for our citizens. Really got to enjoy making an accessible search repository using DataTables jQuery and Cascade CMS.


## What I am currently working on

- Threlte (Svelte + Three.JS) website for eCommerce customization of products.
- AI co-pilot for recreational sailors in navigating global maritime laws, procedures, and policies. (Elixir + Axon)
- Re-working my portfolio website for the 32nd time
