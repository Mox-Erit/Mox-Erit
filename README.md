# Ahoy! My name is Chase (not the bank)

Currently I work as a Software Engineer with the <a href="https://mt.gov/">State of Montana</a>. 

In the past I have been fortunate to be able to have worked in federal, state, and private sectors across multiple industries! This has led me to be able to take on all kinds of challenges and unique roles.
